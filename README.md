# HOW-TO
## Mastering chain

### Mixing:
- Tempo, instruments, layering, input gain (before mixer) etc.  

Prepare your mixer tracks in this order:  
Mixer tracks:  
- subtractive EQ   
- compression  
- additive EQ  
- effects  
- optional routing of multiple tracks to bus for more compression and effects, etc  

Master track:  
- all mixer tracks and bus tracks  
- effects  
- limiter  
- youlean  

### EQ:  
- subtractive EQ on the mixer track for individual instruments  
- effects  
- additive EQ on instrument or master track  
- no big carves in EQ, for dramatic low/high cutoffs  
- if you have above, level out the EQ some and adjust the volume slider for that mixer track  

### Panning:  
- Hihiats 15% left  
- Snare 15% right  
- kick no panning (centre)  
- Adjust other instruments as needed or not at all until it sounds good.  

### Stereo:  
- Bass, kick fully mono  
- Leads and airy stuff separated until it sounds good.  

### Compression:  
- Add to instruments individually or on master chain  
- Use a preset if you can, or ajdust threshold and gain until it sounds good  
- You can use multiple compressors  

### Gain (limiter):  
- On master chain only  
- Use a cieling of -1db  
- Adjust gain until it sounds good.  

### LUFS:  
- Must be last  
- Play entire song for youlean  
- Spot check for short term spikes. If it sounds good, don't bother.
- If too loud or too quiet adjust limiter gain knob and try agin until around -14 LUFS.  

### Export the .WAV file to be used in the visualizer. Place in /audio folder. Place logo image in /img folder.
